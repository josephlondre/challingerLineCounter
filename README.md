# challingerLineCounter
In Judy Challinger's 311 course, it is required of us to have no lines over 80 so this is a simple program that tells you the length of your longest line. Make sure it's not over 80!

How to use:
- make with makefile
- executable name is count
- in order to run the program on a file named myCode.cpp you enter the following at the command line
    count myCode.cpp

Let me know if there are any issues, 
I hope this helps!
